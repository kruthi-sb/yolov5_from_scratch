# yolov5_from_scratch
Understanding yolov5 from the ground up and build it from scratch!

# NOTE:
- ```cumstom_yolov5s.py``` Consists of the actual model architecture implementation.
- ```dev.ipynb``` Includes my first steps in approaching the problem by understnading the dataset format in tensors, model architecture, output shapes in each forwardpass of layers, and finally exporting the model in onnx format to visualize it on Netron.
- ```experiment.ipynb``` is empty right now. It is kept to serve the purpose of testing if the architecture is right and works basicially. 
- ```diagrams``` folder includes the architecture exported from Netron and also the offical Ultralytics architecture.
